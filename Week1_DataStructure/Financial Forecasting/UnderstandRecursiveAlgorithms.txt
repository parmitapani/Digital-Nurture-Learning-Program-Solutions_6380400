The Concept of Recursion is as follows :

Recursion: A method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A recursive function calls itself with a smaller or simpler input.
Base Case: The condition under which the recursive function stops calling itself, preventing an infinite loop.
Recursive Case: The part of the function where it calls itself with a smaller or simpler input.

Example:
To illustrate recursion,here is the calculation of factorial of a number :

Factorial of 5 ==> (5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.
This can be broken down as: 5! = 5 * 4!, 4! = 4 * 3!, and so on.
The base case is 1! = 1.


Recursive Algorithm to Predict Future Values as used in the code :

The recursive method calculateFutureValue takes three parameters:

presentValue: The current value of the financial metric.
growthRate: The growth rate per period.
periods: The number of periods into the future we want to predict.

The method uses the formula:
Future Value=Present Value×(1+Growth Rate)^Periods


Time Complexity:
Recursive Algorithm: The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of periods. Each recursive call reduces the number of periods by one until the base case is reached.

Optimizing the Recursive Solution:
Memoization: Store the results of previous computations to avoid redundant calculations. This is useful if the function is called multiple times with the same parameters.This is also known as Top-Down Dynamic Programming.
